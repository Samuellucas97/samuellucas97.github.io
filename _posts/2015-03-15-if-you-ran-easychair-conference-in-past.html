If you have published or reviewed computer science papers in the past years, you may have ran across <a href="http://www.easychair.org/" target="_blank">EasyChair</a>. EasyChair is a conference management system, storing and managing submitted papers, reviews, and final decisions. It is a great tool for anyone organizing a conference, and it is extremely popular: According to its own data, it has served over&nbsp;<i>a million</i>&nbsp;registered users since 2007.<br /><br />The problem with EasyChair, however, is exactly that it <i>is</i>&nbsp;so popular. &nbsp;Again since 2007, I have acted as reviewer in more than 50 conferences and workshops organized through EasyChair. &nbsp;All their data is still there: As a reviewer, I have access to <i>all</i>&nbsp;papers and <i>all</i>&nbsp;reviews written for each of these conferences. This opens up interesting possibilities for misuse. For instance, I could download all reviews written by my colleagues, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/08/identifying_peo_2.html" target="_blank">train a classifier on their writing styles</a>, and identify them for my past and future papers. I could also check for papers of my colleagues submitted and rejected several years ago, and confront them with the sins of their youth.<br /><br /><a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/1/103200-cloud-computing-privacy-concerns-on-our-doorstep/fulltext" target="_blank">This CACM article</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;Mark D. Ryan neatly summarizes the problem, but also points out that there may be benign uses of all this data. &nbsp;Hence, the scientist in me thinks that deleting all this data may be a bad idea for future historians. &nbsp;What we can and should do, though, is to <i>limit access </i>to it. &nbsp;As a starter, after the conference is over, <i>every program chair should take means that its submissions and reviews can only be accessed by a minimal set of people</i> – in particular, excluding past reviewers to extract all data. &nbsp;Here's how to do this for EasyChair:<br /><br /><ol><li>Log in as program chair.</li><li>In the top menu, go to "Administration" → "Configure".</li><li>Under "Access to Submissions", set</li><ul><li>"Are submissions anonymous?" to "Yes"</li><li>"Can non-chairs see information on submissions not assigned to them?" to "No"</li></ul><li>Under "Paper bidding and assignment", set</li><ul><li>"Is paper bidding enabled?" to "No"</li><li>"Is viewing bids of PC members by chairs enabled?" to "No"</li><li>"Is assignment of submitted papers to program committee enabled?" to "No"</li></ul><li>Under "Reviewing", set</li><ul><li>"Are reviewer's names visible to PC?" to "No"</li><li>"Status menu is" to "disabled"</li><li>"Review menu is" to "disabled"</li><li>"Permit PC members to enter reviews" to "No"</li><li>"Permit non-chairs see and discuss reviews" to "only their own reviews"</li></ul></ol><div>To check the effect of these settings:</div><div><ol><li>In the top menu, go to "PC".</li><li>Select any regular PC member and click on "login as" (the rightmost item)</li><li>All the PC member should now be able to see are the submissions initially assigned to him or her.</li></ol><div>You as a PC chair can still access all papers and reviews, and via the "Configure" menu, you can also re-enable access (for whatever reason). &nbsp;If you configure the settings as above, though, the risk of data leaks will be greatly diminished.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you have similar instructions for other conference management systems, let me know and I will link or include them here. &nbsp;And if you as a reviewer find that your conference management system still grants you access to everything, tell your PC chair about this page. &nbsp;Thanks a lot!</div></div>
