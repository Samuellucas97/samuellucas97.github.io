Ever heard of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s" target="_blank">Paul Erdős</a>? &nbsp;The 20th century Hungarian mathematician is not only known for his numerous contributions to Mathematics, but also for his multiple collaborations, engaging more than 500 collaborators. &nbsp;Frequently, he would just show up on their doorstep, work with them for some hours, and then get a joint paper out of that. &nbsp;A low&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number" target="_blank">Erdős number</a>&nbsp;indicates academic closeness to&nbsp;Erdős, and is something one can brag about at academic venues. &nbsp;Yet, if today, Paul Erdős knocked on your door, and asked whether you would like to work with him, you <i>should avoid any collaboration with him </i>– if you work in Software Engineering, that is. &nbsp;Why is that?<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.icse-conferences.org/" target="_blank">International Conference on Software Engineering</a>, or ICSE for short, is the flagship conference of the field of Software Engineering. &nbsp;If you want to publish and present your greatest work, this is where you submit it. &nbsp;An ICSE submission is reviewed by three peer researchers, whose assessment eventually determines whether your work is accepted or not. &nbsp;Even if your work gets rejected, you at least get detailed reviews and high quality feedback.<br /><br />Over the years, ICSE has observed that there were authors who apparently were way more interested in the reviews than in getting their papers accepted; authors who would submit up to ten papers, of which none got in; but the authors would at least get thirty reviews, all for free. &nbsp;This motivated ICSE to install a new limitation: <a href="http://icse2017.gatech.edu/?q=technical-research-cfp" target="_blank">Any single author can now appear only on up to three papers</a>. &nbsp;If you have four papers ready for submission, then you are supposed to select the best three.<br /><br />The ICSE program chairs&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~martin/blog/2016-04-15.html" target="_blank">argue</a> that few authors and even fewer acceptances would be affected by this decision. &nbsp;But the problem with this decision is not the factual impact. &nbsp;It is the <i>potential impact.</i>&nbsp; What if a modern Paul Erdős knocked on your door and offered you to work with him? &nbsp;You'd have to say no, because he would have too many co-authored submissions already. &nbsp;What if you could not submit to the past conference, because you were the one organizing it, and still have work that wants to get published? &nbsp;What if four of your students all have great results at the same time, results that should be shouted out to the world? &nbsp;Well, too bad: you can only submit three of them, causing depression in the fourth student how is left out. &nbsp;None of these is likely to happen, but the fact that it <i>could</i>&nbsp;happen is causing <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/icse17/" target="_blank">concerns and anxiety</a>, and rightly so. &nbsp;An open&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zeepje-CDp5k73JaO5kFcwZ6Pid_mwTHn42jphiHfks/edit" target="_blank">petition</a> asking ICSE to revert its new rules has gained dozens of supporters overnight. (Disclaimer: me too.)<br /><br />The Software Engineering community has members who have literally devoted their <i>lives</i> to Software Engineering research. &nbsp;They have no spouses, no kids, they work day and night. &nbsp;The boys would be out for a skiing weekend, and the girls would be out in their summer clothes – these folks are busy on the paper that they hope will make them famous. &nbsp;They serve on program committees, they write reviews, they organize conferences, they help others on their PhD theses. &nbsp;They are amazingly productive both on their own work as well as on the work of others. &nbsp;And these are the men and women whom the new ICSE rules send the message: Thank you, but no, thank you.<br /><br />The problem of ICSE – and our community in general – is not so much an abundance of papers. &nbsp;It is the <i>lack of reviews</i>. &nbsp;It is our publications that determine our academic worth; much less so teaching; and even less so service. Great papers get you tenure and a raise, whereas great reviewing might get you a committee dinner. &nbsp;Rationally thinking, why should one spend time on reviews while one might just write papers that would get reviewed by others? &nbsp;Fortunately, the large majority of our community is still driven by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative" target="_blank">Categorical Imperative</a>: We profit from the reviews of others, so we review their papers, too. &nbsp;What we don't like is members who game the system by not only submitting lots of papers, but also <i>not participating in the review process.</i><br /><i><br /></i>Therefore, what our community needs to do is twofold. &nbsp;First, we need to think about reviewing processes that scale well and get high-quality reviews. &nbsp;The ICSE program board model is a step in the right direction; a <a href="http://vldb.org/pvldb/papers/p40-jagadish.pdf" target="_blank">VLDB-like journal model</a> might be even better. &nbsp;Second, we should not penalize researchers for their own productivity; but instead create <i>incentives</i>&nbsp;for researchers who spend great effort on reviews and service. &nbsp;Rule by the carrot, not by the stick.<br /><br />Such incentives for service should not be monetary (these wouldn't motivate researchers anyway); nor should they result in a different reviewing or acceptance process (this would be perceived as unfair). &nbsp;But how about raising the limit of submissions if you have a co-author who is also a frequent reviewer? &nbsp;Or allowing reviewing volunteers to apply for a one-day extension to the conference deadline? &nbsp;(You'd get plenty of applications on the last day :-) &nbsp;Or provide "fast track" journal reviewing for those authors who sport a status of "distinguished reviewer"? &nbsp;With such incentives, if a prolific reviewer like Paul Erdős knocks on your door, you would not boot him, but&nbsp;<i>embrace</i> him instead.<br /><br />
