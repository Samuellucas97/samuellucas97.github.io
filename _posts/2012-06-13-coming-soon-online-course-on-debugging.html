In the past weeks, I have been preparing an <i>online course on software debugging</i> for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>, the Silicon Valley startup that aims to "democratize education". &nbsp;The course will be highly interactive, in seven 60-minute units with quizzes every 2-4 minutes, and deliver a systematic approach to debugging. &nbsp;During the course, I will have the participants build automated debugging tools in Python, such as<br /><ul><li>an interactive debugger,</li><li>delta debugging on inputs,</li><li>inferring dynamic invariants,</li><li>statistical debugging, or</li><li>mining software archives.</li></ul>Preparing these tools in Python was amazingly straight-forward (less than 45 minutes each – but then, I'm an expert); Python offers simple, yet effective tracing facilities that grant access to all events and states during execution. &nbsp;(My only gripe is the lack of easy static analysis.) &nbsp;Since systematic debugging is not frequently found in computer science curricula, I hope to cater to students as well as to professionals who are looking for additional training – and, of course, to<i> improve the state of the practice in debugging.</i><br /><br />I will be spending the next two weeks with Udacity in Palo Alto to record the units. &nbsp;The format will be Udacity-like: Most of the time, you'll only see my hand writing, doodling, sketching, and developing the material on the screen while I am talking. &nbsp;You can always stop and repeat as you like (or fast forward until the next automated quiz). &nbsp;I am pretty excited about the format, and very much look forward to an exciting course as well.<br /><br />To see what an online course at Udacity looks like, check out <a href="http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs262/" target="_blank">Wes Weimer's CS 262: Programming Languages (Building a Web Browser)</a>&nbsp;and go to&nbsp;"Preview the Class".<br />To learn more about the recording process, see <a href="http://blog.regehr.org/archives/716" target="_blank">John Regehr's blog on recording a class at Udacity</a>.<br />To learn more about my work on debugging, see my book <a href="http://www.whyprogramsfail.com/" target="_blank">"Why Programs Fail"</a>.
