<b>I just finished recording an online course on software debugging at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>. &nbsp;The format is superior to anything I could ever deliver in a classroom. &nbsp;Universities should worry.</b><br /><b><br /></b><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>,&nbsp;</span></b>a startup aiming to "democratize university-level education", offers free online courses on various subjects of higher-level education. &nbsp;At this point, it is mostly computer science: artificial intelligence, programming languages, software testing – and soon: software debugging. &nbsp;The Udacity format is pretty unique; what you see for the most time is my hand as it is writing, drawing, and doodling on an electronic sketchpad, while I explain and deliver the material. &nbsp;Every two to three minutes, you get a <i>quiz</i> (which is checked automatically), and you can only proceed if you answered it correctly.<br /><br />The nice thing about this course format is that it combines the<i> best aspects of the classroom and the textbook experience.</i> &nbsp;When I was a student, I have sat through many hours of lectures where math professors delivered one proof after the other. &nbsp;I usually lost track after 10-15 minutes, so what I got from the lecture was a mental note to work through the textbook proof later at my desk. &nbsp;I always thought that this was just my own experience, but I recently found this was actually shared by many of my current PhD students (who happen to be among the best of their class, including math). &nbsp;Simply videotaping such lectures and making them available online will not make them more attractive, and I never felt this to be a viable alternative.<br /><br />With the Udacity format, this is very different: As I am demonstrating a proof, <i>I can come up with a quiz for every step</i>, thus making sure the student really understands what is going on. &nbsp;The fast students will quickly answer the questions, while the slower students will be able to repeat the unit at will until they are ready. &nbsp;In the future, one could even imagine additional explanations for students who keep on failing the quiz, or extra challenges for students who come up with quick correct answers. &nbsp;The course would thus automatically adapt to the weaker as to the stronger students – which is way superior to&nbsp;having a "one-size-fits-noone" classroom lecture.<br /><br />Yes, preparing an online lecture in this format is quite some work; it is like preparing a textbook and its presentation at the same time. But then, your lecture scales to an unlimited number of students. &nbsp;And if the students find the online format more attractive than the classroom format, this will have far-reaching consequences for higher-level education.<br /><br />One could hope that professors will have much more time for face-to-face interaction – in&nbsp;seminars and lab projects, for instance –, and for inspiring and judging the creativity of their students. &nbsp;What I see, though, is that lectures as we know them may face the same fate as the CD, as the DVD, or as the encyclopedia – namely to be replaced by well-done digital offers. &nbsp;That alone is not so much of a problem. &nbsp;But think of the fate of record stores, video rentals, or soon book stores – and you may get an idea of what universities should be fearing.
