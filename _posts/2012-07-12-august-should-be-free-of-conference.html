The deadline for technical papers of this year's&nbsp;<a href="http://2013.icse-conferences.org/" target="_blank">ICSE</a>, the International Conference of Software Engineering, has been set to <b>August 17</b> – a whopping 9 months before the conference takes place, and <b>right in the middle of the busiest holiday month.</b> &nbsp;In most of Europe, schools and kindergartens are closed for holidays during that time, because it is naturally assumed that you'll be on holiday, too. &nbsp;I can't even begin to speculate how such a deadline disrupts holidays and family time – and eventually harms the quality of submissions.<br /><br />In the past ten years, the ICSE deadline has never been that early; except for ICSE 2011, it was always set in September. &nbsp;For me, this means that half of the papers our group intended to submit for ICSE (essentially, all those which aren't complete next week) will now go to ICST instead. &nbsp;Not only is the ICST deadline one month later and thus much more family-friendly, the conference is also two months before ICSE, implying a much quicker dissemination of results.<br /><br />I suggest we as a software research community set up an implicit rule: <b>No paper deadline in August. &nbsp;</b>If an August deadline is unavoidable, it could be used for abstracts (such that PC members can bid on the submissions), followed by a September deadline for the full papers. &nbsp;If you agree, go and press the appropriate button.<br /><br />[<b>Update 2012-12-19:</b> ECOOP 2013 ups the ante by extending their deadline to <b>December 23.</b> &nbsp;Does the conference really expect researchers to drop their holiday preparations and write a paper instead?]<br /><br />
