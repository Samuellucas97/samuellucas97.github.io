For the past three years, my students and I have worked on a novel and general approach to address software security. &nbsp;This week at CeBIT, we're happy to spread some good news. <br /><div><br /></div><div>The concept of "Mining Sandboxes"&nbsp;protects against <i>unexpected changes of software behavior</i> and thus drastically reduces the attack surface of software systems. Our "Boxmate" prototype automatically mines program behavior by <i>executing generated tests</i>, systematically exploring the program’s behavior together with the accessed resources. The collected behavior rules form a <i>sandbox</i>, which at production time prohibits <i>behavior not seen during testing</i>. This brings several compelling features:<br /><div><br /></div><div><div><b>No unexpected behavior changes.</b> The mined sandbox prevents <i>behavior changes </i>caused by latent malware, vulnerability exploitations, malware infections, or targeted attacks.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Closing the backdoors. </b>The mined sandbox protects against <i>backdoors</i> that would not be discovered during normal usage.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>No malware patterns required.</b> The approach assumes no information about earlier or future attacks; it protects against known and novel attacks alike.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>No training in production.</b> In contrast to anomaly detection systems, all “normal” behavior is already explored during testing. The program is protected even before its first deployment.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>No code required. &nbsp;</b>We require no knowledge about source or binary code, and thus can handle obfuscated, obscure, or adverse programs.</div></div><div><br />Want to get a brief overview of how it works?  Here's a video, narrated by yours truly:</div><div><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/99Mi5i_ZNYI" width="560"></iframe></div><div><br />Conceptually, the techniques of Mining Sandboxes&nbsp;scale to arbitrary code size and can be applied to mobile apps, embedded systems, and server software alike. &nbsp;Mining sandboxes is fully automatic, such that vendors, developers, and users can mine, inspect, compare, and exchange sandboxes at any time. &nbsp;And for the testing researchers among us: This research leverages the incompleteness of testing to turn it into an advantage; and to actually produce guarantees from testing. </div><div><br /></div><div>At this point, all of this is still research, so you cannot yet buy this in a shop near you. &nbsp;And as with any big set of benefits, there's also drawbacks, in particular with legitimate functionality not found during testing – and there's still loads and loads of things to do. &nbsp;But our first results with our prototype on real-world apps are more than promising; we have a nice paper coming up at the ICSE conference in May 2016, Austin, Texas. &nbsp;And I am even more excited about this work than any other pioneering work of ours before, even more than say, Delta Debugging, or Mining Software Repositories – because if it succeeds, it would not only impact the lives of software developers, but actually address many of the software security problems we see in the news every day.</div><div><br /></div><div>If this has captured your attention, you can read more about the project at its site: <a href="http://www.boxmate.org/">http://www.boxmate.org/</a>. &nbsp;Or you can visit us at the CeBIT computer fair in Hannover between March 14 and March 18 (Hall 6, Stand D 28); I will be on site Monday and Tuesday. &nbsp;I'd love to get engaged in discussions!</div></div>
