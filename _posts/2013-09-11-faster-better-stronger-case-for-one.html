When running a scientific conference, one has to decide which submitted papers get published (and presented), and which ones are not. &nbsp;Each paper gets a number of reviews; and based on these, the program committee decides which papers get accepted.<br /><br />Flooded with submissions, several SE conferences went for a two-phase model to reduce workload: A paper first gets two reviews, and only if at least one of these favors acceptance, the paper gets a third review. &nbsp;As PC chairs of ASE 2013, we went back to a single-phase model, though. &nbsp;Several people have asked us why this was so. &nbsp;The answer is: time. &nbsp;With a one-phase review, you can cut the time required for reviews in half, thus allowing for more, better, and more recent papers.<br /><br /><br />The math is as follows.&nbsp;Let's assume your conference gets 314 papers submitted (as we had for ASE):<br /><br /><ul><li>In a <i>two-phase</i> model,</li><ul><li>&nbsp;314 papers would have gotten two reviews, totaling 618 reviews.</li><li>1/3 of papers are eliminated in the first round, leaving 210 which get a third review.</li><li>Total number of reviews: 618 + 210 = 828.</li></ul><li>In a <i>one-phase</i> model,</li><ul><li>&nbsp;314 papers get three reviews, totaling 942.</li></ul></ul><br />By having the one-phase model, your conference will thus have <i>14% more reviews</i>&nbsp;– in our case, 22–23 papers to review per PC member instead of 20. &nbsp;However, going for two phases requires a lot more administrative overhead – for the PC chairs, of course, but also for the reviewers. &nbsp;In particular, you need to allocate <i>two phases</i> in which to do the reviews – instead of, say, eight weeks, where reviewers would be free to allocate their load, you now have six + four weeks, each of which may be more easily blocked by travel, holidays, etc. &nbsp;Plus, as a PC chair, you need at least another week in between to reallocate and inform the new reviewers.<br /><br />All in all, you thus trade 14% more reviews against an extension of the review period by three weeks. &nbsp;Not necessarily a good thing. &nbsp;In addition, this assumes that papers are all equal; but they’re not: The 14% extra papers are mostly papers that would be quick rejections anyway. &nbsp;So, not much damage either.<br /><br />Assuming that <i>more</i>&nbsp;than a third of papers may be rejected in the first round favors the two-phase model. &nbsp;But then, there’s the concern that by having only two reviewers, you run a greater risk of one reviewer being incompetent, unwilling, lazy, etc. &nbsp;(It happens to anyone.) &nbsp;So you may be have to introduce <i>rebuttals</i> to compensate for potential misjudgments, and here go another two weeks of reviewing period. &nbsp;And then, someone will have to read these rebuttals, which adds more overhead.<br /><br />To illustrate how two-phase reviews and rebuttals eat up time in contrast to one-phase reviews, let's take a look at ICSE 2014, whose&nbsp;papers are due September 13, 2013. &nbsp;Notification is January 17 – that is, more than <i>four months</i> later. &nbsp; For ASE (one phase, no rebuttals), this was May 17 to July 25 – <i>two months</i> <i>and one week</i>, or roughly half the time ICSE takes. <br /><br />With its short reviewing period, ASE 2013 had more than three times the number of submissions compared to last year, which gave us a great choice of papers. &nbsp;ICSE will also have a record number of submissions; but if you miss the deadline, chances are you will find another conference which will publish your paper well before ICSE.<br /><div><br /></div><div><div>Summary: Get rid of frills, and allow authors six more weeks to prepare their submissions. &nbsp;You will get more, better, and more recent papers – and more, better, independent reviews at the same time.</div></div><div><br /></div>
