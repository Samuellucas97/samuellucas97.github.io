<span style="font-family: inherit;">I am a frequent reviewer of submissions for scientific journals and conferences. &nbsp;By far most of my reviews are specific to the individual paper, its contributions, and its issues. &nbsp;However, there is a small number of presentation problems which I have to report again and again. &nbsp;All these problem are very minor, and none of them will make me reject your paper. &nbsp;However, fixing them is a matter of minutes, and will make your paper an easier read for both readers and reviewers:</span><br /><ol><li><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Abstracts without results</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">. &nbsp;Many abstracts end with the words "We conducted a study to show the effectiveness of our approach". &nbsp;There's three things wrong in here:</span></span></b></li><ol><li><b><span style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: normal;">You conduct a study to <i>evaluate</i> your approach – if you run your study with a predetermined outcome, I will suspect a flaw in your setup.</span></b></li><li><b><span style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: normal;">As a reader of your abstract, I am not so much interested in your process, but in your <i>results</i>; if you want cliffhangers, go and write TV shows instead.&nbsp;</span></b></li><li><b><span style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: normal;">You need results to sell your paper in the review process – in particular for outsiders who take only a brief glance at your paper.</span></b></li></ol><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">So make this "Our study shows a 25% precision increase" or some other strong argument.</span></span><li><b>Multi-letter identifiers in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">LaTeX</a> math mode.</b>&nbsp; In LaTeX, <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">$foo$</span> stands for the product of three variables f, o, and, o; and LaTeX typesets it as such. &nbsp;If you want one variable, use <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">$\textit{foo}$</span>. &nbsp;(For a computer scientist, this is the single biggest design failure of TeX and LaTeX.)</li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Confuse hyphens, minus signs, and dashes.</b>&nbsp; All these typeset into different characters:&nbsp;</span></li><ol><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Hyphens: </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">state-1 is blue, state-2 is red.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Minus signs: </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">$\textit{bar} = \textit{foo} - 1$</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash" target="_blank">En-dashes</a> (for ranges):</span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp;A car has&nbsp;3--4~wheels</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash" target="_blank">Em-Dashes</a> (for sentences): </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">He said ``captain''---I said ``wot''. &nbsp;</span>(This can also be typeset using en-dashes with spaces, as in&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">He said ``captain''~-- I said ``wot''</span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">.</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">)</span></li></ol><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Bad capitalization in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibtex" target="_blank">BibTeX</a> references,</b> as in "[1] Jai: a javascript api ide" (should be "[1] JAI: A JavaScript API IDE") &nbsp;I could include this in all my reviews and be right&nbsp;60% of the time.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Omitting reference information.</b>&nbsp; I see papers omitting page numbers, conference names, editors, or even authors. &nbsp;I suppose that "[1] Smith et al., ICSE 2004" is something I should Google, and I hope there's just one Smith at ICSE. &nbsp;(This even occurs in papers whose venues have no page limit for references!)</span></li><li><b style="font-family: inherit;">Orphaned numbers,</b><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;as in "I want 17&lt;newline&gt;foos." &nbsp;Tie numbers to items using non-breakable space (Word) or using a tilde (LaTeX):&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">I want 17~foos.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Orphaned lines and titles.</b>&nbsp; Section title at end of page 3, actual section on page 4. &nbsp;Better yet: a single line of text left under a table, such that you easily confuse content and caption. &nbsp;"LaTeX gets this wrong" is not an excuse; please fix this.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Using monospacing with a non-monospaced font</b> (or vice versa). &nbsp;This seems to be a default setting of the LaTeX "<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Source_Code_Listings" target="_blank">listings</a>" environment – using Times fonts and arranging the letters at equal distance. &nbsp;Use monospaced fonts with monospacing, and proportional fonts otherwise.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Omitting articles</b>, as in "Main feature is lack of articles". &nbsp;Now that spell checkers weed out the most blatant errors, the more subtle errors remain – and this is my #1 grammar issue. &nbsp;If your native language has no articles, take double care.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Testing the limits.</b>&nbsp; Page limits are there for a reason – not to save trees, but to save the time of your readers by requiring you to focus on the main points. &nbsp;Cramming every little detail into the paper will decrease readability and&nbsp;alienate your readers; it may also lead to desk rejection if you alter the format. &nbsp;Stick to standard style, cut down your paper to one page less than the limit and have your paper proof read by others, then add whatever your proof readers missed.</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">All these issues can be fixed through simple proofreading, and leave your readers and reviewers more time to enjoy the actual content. &nbsp;And now that the syntax is done, let's get back to semantics!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">(As a reviewer or reader, what are your favorite gripes? &nbsp;Use the commenting function below.)</span></div>
