As a professor, I have many responsibilities and tasks to take care of, and many of these have deadlines. &nbsp;To keep track of them, I use an automated "To-Do"-Tracker, which allows me to enter new tasks (and ideas!) quickly, to assign categories and priorities to them, and to mark them as completed when I'm done. &nbsp;Most importantly, I can attach a "due date" to every task, and tell my tracker to automatically have a task pop up a few days in advance – typically the number of days I will need to complete it. &nbsp;So far, this works pretty well: When someone asks me whether I'd be available for a task, I can get a good assessment of my commitments (implying the answer is typically "no"); but if I commit to a task, it will <i>almost certainly be done</i> <i>by its deadline.</i><br /><br />Now, here's the fun thing. &nbsp;Since I use this approach, I get way <i>more</i>&nbsp;reminders than before. &nbsp;Journal editors tell me that my review is due in only five days. &nbsp;PhD students send me worried letters that I haven't sent out the referral letter yet, due on Friday. &nbsp;Conference chairs send me friendly reminders that I am an author, yet haven't registered for the conference, due in a week. &nbsp;Thank you for the reminders – actually,<i> I know all that,</i> as my to-do tracker nicely tells me so, and it is all factored in. Today, I need to work on this paper, this book chapter, this slide deck – all stuff which gets better the earlier it can be reviewed; and I know that the task you remind me off can still wait until due day, or the N days it will take me to complete it. &nbsp;In 2013, I completed 700+ tasks, and there was only one reminder which was effective (because I had mistyped the completion date).<br /><br />Overall, I believe that this "just in time" production makes me more effective, as it puts things in the right order (and the right priority). &nbsp;But then, it apparently strains the nerves of everyone else involved. &nbsp;Should I set up a rule to complete everything a week before it is due? &nbsp;Or should I set up a disclaimer of sorts?<br /><br />(And now back to my "To-Do"-tool: Five days left to complete this paper. &nbsp;Better start today...)<br /><br /><br />
