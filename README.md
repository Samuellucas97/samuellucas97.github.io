## About Me

**I research software.**  I analyze its code, its executions, and how it was made, creating tools that help developers build better software.

I am an influential researcher in the field of software engineering.  I created delta debugging, a technique to minimize inputs and quickly isolate failure causes.  I am co-author of GNU DDD, a visual debugger.  I helped shaping the field of mining software repositories.  I have written textbooks on debugging and testing software.
