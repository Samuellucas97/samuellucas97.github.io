# About Me

I do software research focusing on **help the new generation of IT students and professionals to be up-to-date with industry needs** by understanding their challenges and proposed solutions. My research can potentially influence educators and industry, as well as guiding future researches.

My [Curriculum Vitae](assets/SamuelCV.pdf) lists the most important achievements.
