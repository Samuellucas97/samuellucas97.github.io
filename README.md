# About Me

**We research software.**  My students and I create tools and techniques that help developers build better software - by automatically testing, analyzing, and debugging its code and its development process.

Our approaches have had quite some impact in theory and practice.  My [CV](assets/ZellerCV.pdf) lists the most important achievements.


## My Group

## Theses

If you are a student of Saarland University and have fun with automated program analysis, testing, and debugging, you might want to do a thesis with us.  [Here are the details on how this works.](Theses.md)
