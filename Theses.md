# Doing a Thesis in the Software Engineering Group

If you are a student of Saarland University and have fun with automated program analysis, testing, and debugging, you might want to do a thesis with us.  Here are the details on how this works.

## Important Note

**My group and I are currently at capacity and can not act as advisors for additional theses. We will start advising new theses September 1, 2022.**


## Topic

If you want to do a thesis at our group, please **send me a letter of motivation and your most recent transcript of records.**  I will then set up an appointment with you to discuss possible topics.

Topics will typically be related to our recent research interests.  You will do real research, and some students even had a chance to publish and present your work in front of an international audience.  

You can suggest topics and express interests of your own.  Third-party topics, however, are only acceptable as part of an established 
research cooperation.


## Advisor

Once we have agreed on a topic, you will be assigned an _advisor_ from my group – a PhD student or PostDoc who you will closely work with.  She or he will help you define your _thesis proposal_ as part of the _seminar_.


## Seminar

In the seminar phase, you are supposed to prepare your thesis. The seminar phase comprises the following steps:

### Attendance

You have to attend the seminar on a regular basis.  Details will be sent to you by the seminar organization.

### Preparation

Your advisor will give you literature to read and possibly make you write a prototype or perform some preliminary experiments. This is important to help you understand your topic. This is a major part of the seminar which is mostly done in self-study.

### Proposal

You have to write a _thesis proposal_ that describes the goals of your thesis and the steps required to achieve those goals. See below.

### Talk

Once the proposal is done, you have to give a talk in the seminar.
Upon successful completion of those steps, you get a certificate (Schein) for the seminar. Congratulations!


## Thesis Proposal

Your proposal serves as a contract between you and our chair. It describes a well-defined task and its outcome as well as possible risks. This helps you finish your thesis in time and protects you from unexpected changes.

A thesis proposal is usually between 8 to 10 pages long and consists of the following:

1. _Cover page_ including
	* thesis title
	* your name
	* date
	* revision information, if appropriate
	* names of supervisors and advisors
2. A short _abstract_ (1-2 paragraphs)
3. An _introduction_ into the field, the problem, and the proposed solution (1 page max.)
4. A discussion of the _related work_ that has been conducted before. Discuss how your proposed work is related (and how it possibly advances the state of the art).
5. The _method_ you want to use to address the problem. Explicitly state verifiable hypotheses.
6. The _evaluation_ you want to use to assess how well your solution works. Provide details on how to verify the hypotheses stated earlier (experiments, subjects, measures, ...)
7. A _schedule_ with verifiable milestones to be reached on a specific date. State potential risks for the proposal and their impact, as well as how to mitigate them, including alternatives.
8. Explicit _success criteria_ that will help to assess your thesis, as a list of items:
	* _Must-have criteria:_ Things your thesis must cover to be successful
	* _May-have criteria:_ Things your thesis can cover to improve its value
	* _Must-not-have criteria:_ Things your thesis will not cover (although one may think so)
9. A _bibliography_ listing all references.

A proposal typically undergoes a number of revisions between you and your supervisor; once it officially is handed in, it serves as a blueprint for the thesis. Your proposal will be graded as part of the Seminar.


## Thesis

The earliest point in time when you can start working on your thesis is right after you handed in your thesis proposal and gave a talk in the seminar. As soon as you got the certificate for the seminar, **you have to register your thesis in the same semester or in the semester after you got the certificate.**

After you have registered your thesis you **have to submit the thesis within the deadline set in the registration.** For BSc students, this will normally be three months, for MSc students, this will be six months.

Successful completion of a thesis consists of the following steps:

1. **Implementation.**  Typically, a thesis investigates a hypothesis. Depending on the concrete topic, you'll have to implement a tool and possibly infrastructure to conduct experiments that prove or disprove the hypothesis.
2. **Thesis.**  Once you have completed your experiments and collected the results, you can start writing the thesis.
3. **Talk.**  You will present the results of your thesis in a 30-minute talk in the seminar.

Once you finished the steps described above, you'll get a certificate (Schein) for the thesis. Congratulations!


## Frequently Asked Questions

* **Can I start my thesis during the semester?** Yes, it is absolutely possible to start during the semester.
* **I won't be able to work full-time on my thesis. What can I do?** Your study regulations allow you to apply for part-time study (and a part-time thesis). Contact the examination office for details.
* **Can you extend the thesis deadline?** Once the thesis is registered, extending the deadline is up to the examination office. You can for example apply for a deadline extension if you're sick for a longer period.
* **Can I continue working on my topic after completion?** If you were unable to explore your topic fully and your advisor is also interested in continuing your work, it is sometimes possible to extend your work with a HiWi contract.
