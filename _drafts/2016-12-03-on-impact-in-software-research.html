About this day, some fifteen years ago, I had the most extraordinary conversation of my life. &nbsp;I had just started my job as a tenured professor at Saarland University, and as every new professor, I was busy just getting acquainted, setting things up, starting my first lectures, and more. &nbsp;But then, the dust had settled, and I could finally focus on my long-term goals. &nbsp;So there I was, having lunch with my head of department, Gert Smolka, and he asked me how I was, and I said fine; but there was this one question that had been on my mind:<br /><br />– "In the long run – what is it you expect from me? &nbsp;Bring in money? Write lots of papers? &nbsp;How would you tell if I was the right choice?"<br />– "This is very simple: We expect you to produce great students who will become great professors. &nbsp;Money is just a means. Quality matters, not quantity. &nbsp;Don't worry".<br />– "But it will take years until my students will be professors!"<br />– "Yes, and we will assess you then. But don't disappoint us."<br /><br />I was astonished. &nbsp;This was not what I had learned from colleagues in other places: That they would be measured by paper metrics; that they would be expected to bring in that much money; that they would be expected to teach or graduate that many students. &nbsp;All these were just means and symptoms, according to what I just had heard, and I could not believe it. &nbsp;But Gert was perfectly right: in the years that followed, and to that date, nobody in my department has ever judged me (nor anyone else) on money, publications, or on any other metric in general. &nbsp;Even when I was hired in the first place, I was told I had been the applicant with the fewest publications. &nbsp;Quality matters, not quantity.<br /><br />It has become all the rage to measure researchers by quantitative metrics over publications, money, or teaching. &nbsp;There is a good side to that, namely that it allows to identify those who severely underperform – if you neither publish, nor are successful with grant proposals, nor teach well, you'll have a hard time asking for something. &nbsp;But for those who <i>do</i>&nbsp;perform, quantitative goals may bring in the wrong incentives – because there are simple <i>recipes</i> for fulfilling them:<br /><br /><ul><li>You want to publish lots of papers in great venues? &nbsp;Then take an existing piece of work, introduce some extra machinery, and present your new work as being 5% faster or 3% more accurate than the original work. &nbsp;Which reviewer is going to argue with that? &nbsp;And yet, chances that your improvement will actually be used by anyone are slim, and the citations will still go to the original paper.</li><li>Likewise, there are recipes for bringing in money. &nbsp;Don't bother wasting your time on competitive grant proposals. &nbsp;Instead, cooperate with industry and have your students solve their problems, for instance. &nbsp;Everybody is happy: The company saves money, you satisfy your metric, and your student may even find a job in said company, plus a PhD as reward. &nbsp;You won't be able to publish that work, but then, who cares?</li></ul><br />Both recipes work – in the sense that they help your metrics. &nbsp;But then, metrics may be all you ever get. &nbsp;This is not to say you should not publish – of course you should publish if you have something to tell. &nbsp;And this is not to say you should not cooperate with industry – yes, you should, such that you understand where the problems are and what solutions may make sense. &nbsp;But is is not your job to publish papers for the sake of publishing papers; and it is not your job to bring in money for the sake of bringing in money. &nbsp;Your job is to find meaningful and lasting solutions to common problems. &nbsp;Your job is to change the world.<br /><br />There are metrics for long-term impact (citation indices, awards, academic offspring, ...). &nbsp;But the actual goal you want to pursue is to have your impact come as a label attached to your name, such as "Did you see that woman in the corner? &nbsp;That's X, the inventor of Y". &nbsp;The question is: how do you get to that label, that magical "Y". &nbsp;Are there <i>recipes</i> for that?<br /><br /><br /><br />Disruption. &nbsp;Cannot be incremental. &nbsp;Solves a real problem.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />There are some few researchers in my field who are able to both work well with industry and abstract their insights into great papers, but chances are it is not you.<br /><br />But they will lead you away from long-term impact.<br /><br />(Been there, done that, guilty.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hence, I do not have to chase money for the sake of money, and I do not have to write papers for the sake of writing a paper. &nbsp;This allows me to focus on my long-term goal – having impact in research.<br /><br />"Impact" is what I translate Gert's ideal of producing great professors into. &nbsp;Fact is, my professors metric could certainly be better – but I have produced a number of great researchers who now are working at Microsoft, Google, and other places, and some of them have a greater impact than any professor at a University, including myself, could ever have had.
